	abstract = {The most important thing of using model checking technology to verify production knowledge base is to build system model from rule set. It is a fundamental but time-consuming job. This paper presents an efficient formal method to verify production knowledge base. Two main contributions of this paper are as follows. Firstly, we propose a dynamic modeling method to build system model of knowledge base, this method utilizes the dynamic procedural nature of production rule to build system model, and it improves the modeling efficiency significantly; Secondly, a conditional transition system based on the standard transition system is given to represent system model, our conditional transition system contains the whole information about the actual state transition process, which solves the information loss problem of the static transition system built by static modeling method and improves the efficiency of error diagnosis.},

	title = {An Operational Semantics for {UML} {RT-Statechart} in Model Checking Context},
	doi = {10.1109/ICICSE.2009.15},
	abstract = {Model checking {UML} statechart can detect various errors and inconsistencies of current system design in the early process of development. However, because of classic statechart lacking of real-time operational semantics, it can not be directly used to verify real-time property of current system. This paper introduces related definition of clock to extend {UML} statechart to real-time {UML} statechart, defines the main elements of statechart by tuple and proposes a middle expression form of statechart {SC.} Through defining the operational semantics of {SC,} the conversion from {SC} to transition system is achieved and a conversion algorithm is given. Based on the above theories, the general approach for model checking {SC} is described, and in the end, a classic study case of conversion from {SC} to {TS} is given.},
